# GNULinuxLibraryCreation
Creation and usage of C Libraries in a Linux environment

This is a class project designed to demonstrate the creation of libraries with separate modules as well as their usage.
There are 3 main directories:
  - A, which contains the creation and use of a Dynamic Link Library
  - B, which contains the creation and use of a shared library
  - C, which contains the creation and use of a static library
 
 The Libraries and their usage in each directory are the same, the difference stems from their type.
 A and B each contain their own Makefile to compile and link the Library and main program. C simply contains a script instead.
